Freddy, Ashley, and Biswas Higher Order functions Mini Project

## Description

The main goal of our project was to clairfy for all what exactly higher order functions are and compare and constrast them in Python and Scala. We start by explaining what high order functions are and what they are used for. We then get into the actual comparing and constrasting of the higher order functions in Python and Scala. We demonstrate two different functions and their implementations in both languages. From our research and gaining a deeper understanding of higher order functions, we came to the conclusion that they are really not different in how they operate except for the syntax of them. Any programming lanugage that allows higher order functions works almost exactly the same except for a few minor implementation differences.

## Repository Organization

Our intital first draft of our script is saved under script.pdf with the final draft as Mini Project Script.pdf. Unfortunetly our recording was too large to add directly to github but has been added to YouTube. Our slides are located in Mini Project Slides.pdf which were used for demontrating and presenting in the video.
